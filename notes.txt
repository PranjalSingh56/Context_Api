Axios = it is the promise based http client to make API request in react
syntax = 
without axios -url repeated

const api = axios.create({
    baseURL:"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com",
    header:{
        "Content-Type":"application/json",
    },
});

if base url changes we have to change everyware, hard to maintain
